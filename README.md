# This project focuses on creating a mini auction/e-commerce site with a primary emphasis on developing database models. In keeping with this focus, JavaScript and extensive CSS styling have been omitted.

# Key features:

1. Registration/Login
2. Ability to create listings, including specifying a title, starting bid, description, and image (via URL)
3. View a list of all available listings
4. Add and remove listings from a personal watchlist for easier tracking
